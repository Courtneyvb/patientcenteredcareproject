**Why should I become a phase II clinic?**\
The data shows that both physicians and patients all enjoy and benefit from the *Patient Centered Care Project*. You can expect to experience increased fulfillment from your work and reduced feelings of burnout. Reducing the administrative work allows you to spend your day how *you* want to. Your patients may have improved satisfaction with the care they receive.\ 
You'll also get to be on the leading edge of improving physicians' experience and enhancing health care. This will be an amazing opportunity to collaborate with other like-minded physicians who are motivated to improve the jobs of physicians and making positive change to the health care patients receive.\
You will also receive the full support of our experienced team and all resources we have created to help the project run smoothly. All costs incurred to you for equipment and time spent outside of regular clinic practice will be covered by the grant. You will get to visualize the data that comes from your clinic on your own personalized dashboard, as well as getting to see the overall results from all participating clinics. These will lead to opportunities to present and publish findings from the study at conferences. 

**What are the responsibilities of becoming a phase II clinic?**\
Phase II clinics are required to collect data on the time they spend on administrative tasks (i.e. charting, dictations, billing) and with patients for ~2-weeks at 5 timed intervals (baseline, 2-weeks, 1-, 3-, and 6-months following project implementation) in order to get a comprehensive understanding of how you are spending your time before the project and after the project starts at your clinic. Your MOA, receptionist, students, or research assistants will also have to help administer surveys during these 2-week time frames at the specified time frames. These typically take <5 minutes and are done after the physician leaves the room. Lastly, you and your MOA/scribe will be asked to complete the *Professional Fulfillment Index* once every 2-weeks which takes ~2-minutes. All data collection tools are digital for your convenience.

**Will I have to hire more staff?**\
We recognize that each clinic has unique demands that is fulfilled by different roles from their staff. We found it beneficial to hire and additional part-time receptionist to help administer surveys and with data collection. However, the MOA-scribe is typically only in the room for the last 5-minutes of the appointment which may be feasible to do with your current clinic setup. Should you find the need to hire an additional MOA or receptionist, their wages will be covered by the grant. We are happy to work with the unique needs of your clinic to ensure the project runs smoothly.
