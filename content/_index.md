Administrative burden is one of the leading causes of physician burnout in North America and it contributes significantly to job  dissatisfaction amongst health care providers. While EMRs were designed to alleviate this burden on physicians, patients often describe their use as off-putting and disruptive.
This project aims to optimize physicians’ time via human and AI scribes, as well as empowering patients to be part of their health care journeys. By using resources already available in most physicians’ offices, the Patient Centered Care Project is a sustainable way to make meaningful changes in the way health care is delivered, for both physicians and patients.

"*In launching our initiative, we’ve embarked on a mission not just to lift the weight of administrative tasks from the shoulders of Canada’s physicians but to restore the heart of healthcare—uninterrupted, high-quality, compassionate patient care. This project is a promise to every patient that their well-being is our utmost priority*"
