# About the Patient Centered Care Project
Administrative burden is one of the leading causes of physician burnout in North America and it contributes significantly to job  dissatisfaction amongst health care providers. While EMRs were designed to alleviate this burden on physicians, patients often describe their use as off-putting and disruptive.
This project aims to optimize physicians’ time via human and AI scribes, as well as empowering patients to be part of their health care journeys. By using resources already available in most physicians’ offices, the Patient Centered Care Project is a sustainable way to make meaningful changes in the way health care is delivered, for both physicians and patients.

## Aspects of the Project
### *Office Redesign*
The current way that many medical offices are setup have physicians or health care providers and patients on opposing sides of a desk, where patients are unable to see their medical records or diagnostic results. We have removed this physical barrier that contributes to inequitable power dynamics and instead sit together with patients at a round table to foster a collaborative approach. This design also intentionally invites family members or other patient advocates to be a part of the meeting and a part of the decision-making process in the patients’ health care path. Instead of a physician sitting behind a computer looking privately at the medical records, the patients results and medical history will be projected on a wall in the office so that all members of the health care team, including the patient and their advocates, can see during relevant parts of the appointment. A medical office assistant will also be present, taking notes that the patient will be able to take with them at the end of the appointment to ensure they feel well informed about all aspects of the appointment. The medical office assistant will also writeup any requisitions or referrals during the meeting to expedite to ensure timely care to the patient.
 
### *Human and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scribes*
Many patients and physicians are dissatisfied with their use in patient appointments, finding that electronic health record’s divide physicians’ attention between the computer and the patient. Using an artificial intelligence (AI) scribe physicians will be able to give patients their full attention, allowing them to provide higher quality care. Having a medical office assistant monitor the AI scribe will minimize distractions and ensure that all records are accurate and complete. Together, this will work to meet the project's goal of reducing administrative burden, while improving patient centered care.
 
### *Project Scope*
Currently, this exciting project is underway at Dr. Laurie and Christopher Main’s internist clinic here in Salmon Arm. Over the next 2 years, we aim to expand the project to other practices here in Salmon Arm and across the Interior Health region to provide deliver high quality, patient centred care in our communities. Following the successful uptake in these clinics, we envision this project being adopted in clinics across British Columbia and, ideally, Canada.
